# Welcome to Full Stack - Level 1

## Objectives

* Given the API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users create a webpage that displays user data
* Only allow the user to select from a subset of the available keys from a dropdown
* The dropdown has to be dynamically populated on page load
* Display the user's name + value of the selected key in a table
* Correctly handle values of keys which are not strings (i.e. Address)
* Project must be source controlled

## Bonus Objectives

* Instead of using the given API, implement a RESTful API that serves the same data
* Serve application in a Docker container using the Nginx Image
* Instead of a single field, allow users to select multiple keys
